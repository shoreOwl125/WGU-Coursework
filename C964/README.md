This folder contains the notebook for the senior capstone project for WGU's CS program.

This research project involved utilizing TensorFlow / Keras to build a Convolutional Neural Network which can predict product review sentiment for the context of medication product reviews.   
It has an interactive text field at the end which allows the reader to create their own medication product review and test the model sentiment prediction on the review.
