So, I ended up taking the morning after pill every time we would have sex without condoms. To make a long story short, I ended up taking 4 pills in a time period of 3 months. (Stupid, I know!) \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI took these pills and thought nothing of it. Until, I started feeling the symptoms that come with it: I was depressed (crying over anything), sleeping 18 hours a day, lost appetite, bloating, my breasts were tender and tingling, frequent urination, nausea, dizziness, wild vivid dreams, etc... I actually thought I was pregnant because it gives you EVERY symptom of pregnancy. \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nAfter noticing all these symptoms, I decided to stop using these pills and to remind myself to buy condoms. I haven't taken another pill for 3 months, and all I can say is ITS NOT OVER!!! Three months later, I am still haunted by the long term side effects of the pill.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI gained 10 pounds from the pill! I've always been skinny and muscular; it's gone! I have a gut and a muffin top for the first time in my life! Had to get new jeans in a bigger size because I could no longer fit in them. My breasts grew a whole cup size bigger and had to get a brand new bra wardrobe. My physical body was ruined by these pills!! :( BUT THATS NOT ALL!! \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nThe pill had given me a yeast infection, which was then followed by a urinary tract infection, and the urinary tract infection eventually caused Bacterial vaginosis, in which 3 months later, I am still dealing with!!! I WAS NEVER THE SAME!\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nPlease stay away from this pill! Use condoms or some other type of birth control. This will ruin your life in every aspect: mental, emotional, physical, internal... Please take my advice and avoid this as much possible. If it's a true emergency, go and take it, but don't be stupid like me! Be proactive when it comes to sex! This pill isn't something to fool around with!\\\"\",\n{\n            'v': 0,\n            'f': \"0\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 35,\n            'f': \"35\",\n        },\n\"\\\"somewhat helpful with the flashes, pricing is out of control, was paying 55, 60 65 and today 86.\\\"\",\n{\n            'v': 0,\n            'f': \"0\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 36,\n            'f': \"36\",\n        },\n\"\\\"I have been having back pain since 1998, when I had my first spinal fusion. My back is now a solid unit from L3 south.  I am going to see my spine surgeon to see about fixing the latest pain problems. I change my patch every 48 hours. I used the Watson patches for several years.  They were effective, except for the falling off mentioned by others.  Paper tape solves that issue.  My latest experience is with Nylan. These have been wonderful; they actually stay on my skin and the amount of fentanyl is much more consistent.  My new ones are from Mallinckrodt/Covidien. We will see how they work. Before I was put on patches, I went through all the usual meds. They would help, but not keep the pain under control. Patches are the way to go.\\\"\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 37,\n            'f': \"37\",\n        },\n\"\\\"I've been on Rexulti 1 mg for a year after being on Abilify for a year or longer taken off because it didn't work and I gain a lot of weight.

A year later, blood sugar levels were great, but I had gained enough weight to go up two waist sizes. (Before the Lantus, my weight held steady.) Changed from Diamicron to Invokana, blood sugar numbers still good (A1C 5.8), and it took four months to lose the two waist sizes I gained. I am still losing weight, and have been able to reduce my nightly insulin dose by about 10%. No other side effects (e.g. no UTI's), kidneys are fine (my doctor includes that in the lab work).

However, I completed my treatment in August 2009 and I haven't had any problems with my endometriosis at all. My doctor has now given me the option to either get pregnant or continue with birth control pills until I decide to become pregnant to maintain the endometriosis. I highly recommend this method if you can withstand the side effects.\\\"\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 70,\n            'f': \"70\",\n        },\n\"\\\"So I take this on and off.

Needless to say it's nice to go to the bathroom. But when I have to fit in a wedding dress in 29 days I think I'll pass on the medication. The weight gain, water rent entire, severe bloating stomach.

I've been taking it for a little over 4 years and it is very effective with  minimal side effects - mostly physical symptoms like slight dizziness from time to time and slight discoloration on my face which is easily covered with powder.  Over the course of the last year or two, my periods went from your average 5 to 7 day period to a very nice 3 day, very light period.\\\"\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 72,\n            'f': \"72\",\n        },\n\"\\\"I, too, have had great results with this medication.

A year ago I could feel an outbreak coming and did some research online and found acyclovir. I read the reviews and figured I'd try it.

Yesterday I woke up and realized over night with no notice a huge sore had formed and the virus was on full unrestricted attack. Went out, got Acyclovir and again, within 24hours what was bound to be a huge long drawn out cold sore had stopped, shrunk and began healing. Acyclovir with Abreva has proved to be a miracle. TRY IT!

I was prescribed zofran to offset the nausea but that is not so helpful either since the zofran causes constipation.

At that time I'm not aware that one of it's side effects was dry mouth/throat. Aside from that, I didn't feel anything anymore after couple of days. I'll use it again for my next fishing trip.

So I went back to my doctor for advice and she put me on the pill for 3 months alongside the implanon. This worked a treat!

The side effects that I have experienced are constipation, slight dry mouth, slight lightheadedness occasionally, and some stomach issues with pain and cramping that are resolving. I was a carboholic previously and have cut down drastically. I would have a glass of wine with dinner on my nights off and really don't even want that.

I have been on and off multiple antidepressants and couldn't find one that made me feel like myself again. Finally, when I started to experience severe mood swings and found myself becoming angry for no reason to the people I loved, I decided I should try to get help once again. My doctor started me on Brintellix and it has helped me so much. Fortunately, I don't experience any side effects.  My mood is elevated, I'm gaining my confidence back, I'm more motivated, and most importantly I feel like myself again. I'm taking 10mg currently and find no need to go to a higher dose.

Now that I've had it for more then 9 months I have my complete sex drive back, bleeding has come more regular but still kind of crazy, my skin has cleared up and I'm feeling less depressed.

Over the years I've noticed its effectiveness wanes. Increasing the dosage causes dizziness and doesn't seem to solve the problem. However I have been tried on 3 other seizure medicines and they did not help at ALL, so I feel I have no choice but to stick with the rough journey on Carbatrol.

        "Build the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on top of the embedding layer. The CNN model I will be using is a separable convolutional neural network which is a special version of a convolutional neural network with depthwise separable convolutions. This model was chosen because it is a sequence model meaning it utilizes word order information rather than just word count information. It was also recommended for text classification in a recent developers.google publication:\n",

        "Building a model also involves choosing a loss function, number of layers and an Activation function for the output layer of the network. The loss function chosen for this model is called binary cross-entropy. Why choose this particular loss function? Since there is two labels a binary loss function is appropriate. The cross-entropy component also known as logarithmic loss is used in binary problems to optimize the loss (discrepency between predicted vs actual label) on all observations it is trained on. The mathematical formula can be found in the following link:\n",
