This project is a project for C950 Data Structures and Algorithms II. 
This project consisted of expirementing with different data structures and search algorithms to find the
most efficient solution for a package delivery problem.
This package delivery system is built using Python and utilizes CSV data for delivery addresses and their distances to one another,   
as well as package constraints. Generates optimized delivery routes for efficient package delivery.
